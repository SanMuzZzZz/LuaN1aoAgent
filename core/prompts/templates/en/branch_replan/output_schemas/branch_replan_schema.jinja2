**⚠️ Critical Constraints:**
- The `dependencies` field **must not** contain any task ID from the `dead_end_tasks` list
- New tasks should depend on **healthy, completed tasks**, or set `dependencies` to an empty array `[]`
- An empty dependency means the task is a direct child of the root task, depending on no other task
