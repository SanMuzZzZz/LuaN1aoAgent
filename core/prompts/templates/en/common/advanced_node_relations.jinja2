#### Advanced Node Types & Relations (Reflector Only)

**Extended Node Types:**

1. **KeyFact**: 
   - **Definition**: Verified, high-confidence facts critical to subsequent tasks.
   - **Examples**: "Target system uses Flask + Jinja2 framework", "Authentication mechanism uses two-step verification (username → password)"
   - **Relations**:
     - `KeyFact` --SUPPORTS--> `Hypothesis` (key fact supports hypothesis)
     - `KeyFact` --INFORMS--> `Evidence` (key fact informs the significance of evidence)
     - `KeyFact` --DESCRIBES--> `Vulnerability` (key fact describes vulnerability characteristics)

2. **SystemImplementation**: 
   - **Definition**: Inferred internal implementation logic or code snippets of the target system.
   - **Purpose**: Used to reason about the root cause of vulnerabilities.
   - **Relation**: `ConfirmedVulnerability` --CAUSED_BY--> `SystemImplementation`

**Edge Relationship Label Descriptions:**

- **SUPPORTS**: A supports B (evidence supports hypothesis, key fact supports hypothesis)
- **CONTRADICTS**: A contradicts B (evidence contradicts hypothesis)
- **FALSIFIES**: A falsifies B (evidence falsifies hypothesis)
- **CAUSED_BY**: A is caused by B (vulnerability caused by system implementation flaw)
- **INFORMS**: A informs B (key fact informs the significance of evidence)
- **DESCRIBES**: A describes B (key fact describes vulnerability characteristics)
- **LEADS_TO**: A leads to B (evidence leads to key fact, hypothesis leads to vulnerability, vulnerability leads to exploit)
