### Response Analysis Framework

## Core Objective
Accurately identify key information in tool output, transform raw responses into actionable intelligence, supporting hypothesis verification and vulnerability confirmation.

## Standard Analysis Process

### Step 1: Response Feature Extraction
**Key features that must be recorded**:
1. **Status Code**: Record HTTP status code and changes
2. **Response Length**: Response body length in bytes and differences
3. **Response Time**: Request completion time and delay characteristics
4. **Response Headers**: Key header changes
5. **Response Body**: Error messages, data leaks, echo content, etc.

### Step 2: ResponseAnalysis Dimensions
**Must include a ResponseAnalysis subsection in `thought.step4_observation_analysis`**

#### Analysis Dimensions:
- Status code and redirect changes
- Header difference analysis
- Request body encoding check
- Cookie detail analysis
- Body length and structure changes
- Error fingerprint identification
- Filter/WAF alerts
- Timing characteristic analysis
- Baseline comparison conclusions

### Step 3: ErrorPattern Recognition
**Must include an ErrorPattern subsection in `thought.step4_observation_analysis`**

#### Common Vulnerability Categories & Evidence:
- SQL Injection: syntax error, OperationalError, etc.
- NoSQL Injection: MongoError, $where anomalies, etc.
- SSTI: {{7*7}} echo, Jinja2 errors, etc.
- Deserialization: pickle/yaml stack traces
- SSRF: timeout, internal address access anomalies
- File Upload/Path Traversal: Path traversal detection

## Output Requirements
**Must include in `thought.step4_observation_analysis`**:
1. **ResponseAnalysis**: Item-by-item comparison with conclusions
2. **ErrorPattern**: List candidate vulnerability categories with evidence

**If unable to determine**:
- Explain the reason for "insufficient differences"
- Propose next verification steps
