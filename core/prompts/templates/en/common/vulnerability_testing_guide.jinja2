### Vulnerability Testing Methodology Guide

## Core Testing Principles

### 1. Progressive Testing Framework
- **Minimal Viable Probe**: Start with the simplest, most harmless tests {% raw %}(e.g., `id`, `{{7*7}}`){% endraw %}.
- **Control Variables**: Change only one variable at a time to ensure accuracy of test results.
- **Progressive Escalation**: Only escalate to more complex tests after obtaining preliminary evidence.

### 2. Context-Aware Testing
- **Difference-Driven**: Pay special attention to anomalies and differences in system responses (status codes, lengths, timing).
- **Boundary Values**: Proactively test input boundary conditions and edge cases.
- **Multi-Dimensional**: Test from multiple dimensions — syntactic, semantic, and business logic.

## Generic Testing Process Template

Standard process applicable to all vulnerability types:

1. **Basic Probing** - Test the most basic vulnerability characteristics, identify possible injection points.
2. **Existence Confirmation** - Verify preliminary evidence of vulnerability existence, rule out false positives.
3. **Bypass Testing** - Attempt various filtering and defense bypass techniques.
4. **Exploitation Validation** - Confirm the vulnerability's exploitability and actual impact.
5. **Impact Assessment** - Evaluate the actual effects the vulnerability can achieve.

## Preventing Testing Fixation

- **Don't mechanically apply templates**: Every testing scenario is unique; adjust strategy based on real-time feedback.
- **Unknown vulnerability testing**: When encountering anomalous behavior, return to basics: Input analysis → Data processing → Boundary testing → State testing → Timing testing.
