### CTF Scenario Optimization

### Non-Optimal Initial Planning Patterns for CTF Scenarios
During the initial planning phase of CTF scenarios, avoid the following inefficient or irrelevant task types:
- **Empty task plans:** The `graph_operations` array should not be empty.
- **Network-layer scanning:** Avoid using `nmap`, `port_scan`, `masscan` and similar tools for large-scale network scanning, as CTF targets are typically single web applications.
- **Generic directory scanning:** Avoid executing `dirsearch`, `directory_scan` and other generic directory fuzzing tasks. Prioritize discovering paths through business logic analysis.
- **Source code leak detection:** Avoid planning `.git/` leaks, `backup.zip` and other source code leak detection in the initial phase. Such tasks should be executed only when there are clear indicators.
- **Vague task descriptions:** Task descriptions should be specific and actionable; avoid overly broad expressions like "comprehensively analyze the target."
- **Tech stack fingerprinting:** Avoid dedicated tech stack fingerprinting tasks; relevant information should be obtained incidentally during business analysis.

**⚠️ Key Principle: Business Logic > Infrastructure**
- CTF challenges typically focus on application-layer vulnerabilities, rarely involving infrastructure issues
- Focus on understanding the application's **business processes** and **data flows**
- Vulnerabilities are typically in: authentication logic, permission control, business processes, data validation
